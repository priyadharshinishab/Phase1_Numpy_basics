# Phase1_Numpy_basics
NumPy is used to hold raw numeric data (logs, metrics, sensor values, scores, features) before ML models.
# NumPy Basics (Day 1)

## Objective
Learn how numerical data is represented and processed using NumPy.

## Topics Covered
- Creating arrays
- Zeros, Ones, Arange, Linspace
- 1D and 2D arrays
- Row-wise sum and mean

## Task
Created a student marks matrix (5x3) and calculated:
- Total marks per student
- Average marks per student

## Output
Total marks: [253 195 275 150 294]  
Average marks: [84.3 65. 91.6 50. 98.]

## Skills Gained
- Data representation
- Vectorized computation
- Matrix operations

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy

## Day 2 – Indexing & Data Filtering

### Tasks
- Calculated average marks
- Filtered students with average > 75
- Replaced marks < 40 with 0
### Output
Average marks: [53.66666667 39.66666667 78.66666667 92.         43.33333333]
Students with average > 75:
 [[60 98 78]
 [88 95 93]]
Marks after replacing < 40 with 0:
 [[50  0 72]
 [ 0 50  0]
 [60 98 78]
 [88 95 93]
 [ 0 60 45]]

### Skills Gained
- Boolean indexing
- Data filtering
- Data cleaning
