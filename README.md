# Phase1_Numpy_basics
NumPy is used to hold raw numeric data (logs, metrics, sensor values, scores, features) before ML models.
# Phase 1 – NumPy Basics (Day 1)

## Objective
Learn how numerical data is represented and processed using NumPy.

## Topics Covered
- Creating arrays
- Zeros, Ones, Arange, Linspace
- 1D and 2D arrays
- Row-wise sum and mean

## Task
Created a student marks matrix (5x3) and calculated:
- Total marks per student
- Average marks per student

## Output
Total marks: [253 195 275 150 294]  
Average marks: [84.3 65. 91.6 50. 98.]
